# LNspec

VHDL from matlab spectrometer code.

Script `python.py` in matlab directory will create the neccessary `.m`
files from the source squared files in matlab/src (fixing constants,
making individual instances, etc, since matlab language is missing
some fairly basic features).

Run `spectrometer_tb` as a test bench inside matlab.

To compile use `make` matlab function.
